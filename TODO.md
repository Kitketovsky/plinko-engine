## Sound

- [x] Add sound when the ball hits a peg
- [x] Higher velocity -> louder the sound

## Pegs

- [x] Make peg bounce / jiggle on collision to make pinball like effect

## Slots

- [x] Render slots
- [x] Determine if a balls falls to a certain slot
- [] Render multiplier value in the center of a slot

## Mechanics

- [] Predetermined outcomes with simulation-based approach (Pre-run thousands of simulations and map initial conditions to outcomes)

## Fix

- [] What are the ways to pass data without making custom properties to Matter.Body object?
